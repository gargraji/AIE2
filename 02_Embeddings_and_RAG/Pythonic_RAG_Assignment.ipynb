            "### For Loop\n",
            "\n",
            "A `for` loop is typically used when you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string).\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
            "\n",
            "for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "    print(fruit)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### While Loop\n",
            "\n",
            "A `while` loop is useful when you want to repeat an action until a certain condition is met.\n",
            "\n",

            "1. **Keep It Simple**: Strive to make your loops straightforward and easy to understand.\n",
            "2. **Use `enumerate()` for Indexing**: If you need both the index and the value, use `enumerate()` in your loop.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",

            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Avoid Infinite Loops**: Make sure your loop has a clear exit condition, especially for `while` loops. Use `break` to exit the loop if necessary.\n",
            "4. **List Comprehensions**: For simple tasks where you create lists, consider using a list comprehension, which can be more concise and often more efficient.\n",
            "   \n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Use `range()` for Number Sequencing**: If you need to iterate a specific number of times, use `range()`.\n",
            "\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   for i in range(5):\n",
            "       print(i)\n",
            "   ```\n",

            "\n",
            "Sometimes, you'll find yourself needing nested loops. In such cases, keep readability in mind:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "for i in range(3):\n",
